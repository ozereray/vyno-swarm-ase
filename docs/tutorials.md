# Quick Start Tutorial

Learn how to simulate a simple autonomous car swarm in under 5 minutes.

### Step 1: Initialize Agents

Create a list of autonomous agents representing vehicles on a highway.

### Step 2: Simulate Sensor Data

Provide varying confidence levels to simulate a "dirty sensor" scenario on one of the vehicles.

### Step 3: Run the Consensus Engine

Watch how VYNO identifies the faulty agent and maintains system safety.
