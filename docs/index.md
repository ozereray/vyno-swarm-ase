# Welcome to VYNO 🐝

**VYNO** is a high-performance, open-source framework for building **Autonomous Swarm Ecosystems (ASE)**.

### The Vision

In traditional autonomous systems, a single sensor failure can lead to catastrophic results. VYNO solves this by introducing a **Decentralized Swarm Consensus** layer. By distributing intelligence across multiple agents, VYNO ensures that the system remains resilient even if individual units encounter errors.

### Core Pillars

- **Physical Intelligence (PI):** Bridging the gap between neural networks and physical world constraints.
- **Swarm Consensus:** Real-time peer-validation of autonomous decisions.
- **Global Scalability:** Designed to support ecosystems ranging from urban mobility to industrial automation.
